I just came back from solo traveling around parts of Europe; specifically Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. On my flight back, I reflected on my life experiences so far and tried to see what I could take away from it. Here is what I came up with.

### Context

Growing up, I was a very introverted person. Around the age of 12, I found out I have moderate to severe hearing loss. This means that without hearing aids it's very hard to hear what others are saying. The problem was that I was **very** self conscious about wearing them. As a result, my social life and happiness suffered tremendously.

Long story short, in an effort to change things, I moved with my father across the country. This gave me a chance to change the image I had of myself. I started applying myself more in the things I love. I also tried to make more friends. One small problem with this was that I had zero social skills because I couldn't hear people in the past because I couldn't hear people. I was literally that cringy dude on social media. Despite this, I got better and found a great group of friends during college. I also tried out a lot of new things, which became a inspiration for this trip.

Recently, I graduated early with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/) and begun my job search. During my search, I realized I was very burnt out to the point where I disliked coding. One day, I was looking at the projects I have worked on, and realized that I have a lot of connections in Europe. Knowing this, I had some money saved up and decided to figure out a way I could visit them all.

### Takeaways

##### My General Mindset

Going into this trip I would say that the general mindset of my life revolved around success. How will doing x change my outcome towards y? If this concept is put into code it would look something like:

```ts
//big number :)
const goal = Number.MAX_VALUE;
//smallish number
let progress: number = 68;
const change = (x: number) => {
  progress = progress + x;
};
//change(1)
change(Math.Random() * Number.MAX_VALUE);
```

While in some instances this mindset is okay, it has many relationships and hobbies being hindered. It also has led me to avoid enjoying the little things in life.

##### Being Open To Conversation

Solo traveling forced me to get out of my comfort zone _a lot_. As a result, I now feel a lot more comfortable about striking conversation with people I don't know. A big realization I had was that 98% of the time no one really cares that much about what you say, how you act is more important.

Another thing that I found really interesting was that I had a lot of conversations that are tended to be avoided in the US. In general, it seemed to me like people were very open to having those conversations without immediately going "Hey!, you're a bad person for believing in x".

Now that I'm back in the US it's been tough just hearing people complaining about the other side.

#### Don't freak out if something doesn't go your way

This is a huge issue I used to have. I used to get very anxious if a certain event didn't occur the way I wanted to. Over time, this became non-existent, but when I was traveling there were a lot of situations that would have caused me to freak out.

One example of this is when security at the airport in Brussels got canceled, which led me to miss my flight to Stockholm (RIP). Old me would have just freaked out and not done anything, but I ended up figuring out a way to get to Amsterdam; as a result, I ended up seeing [Alan Walker](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7vk5e3vY1uw9plTHJAMwjN?si=0ocllsUoQI2eX3mgZNfjow) and [Diplo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5fMUXHkw8R8eOP2RNVYEZX?si=cQqPLtSYQb296djpuXI_Nw). I also met a ton of cool people who I still talk to today.

#### Conclusion

Solo traveling make me realize a variety of things about myself:

- I need some form of a high level plan.
  - I tended to have better days when I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but there was nothing concrete.
- I prefer working remote or hybrid.
  - After doing this, I strongly am for remote working. I want to have the freedom to recreate this past month even if I am working during it.
- I am a lot happier when I focus on the things that I am passionate about. I hope this leads to more success ðŸ˜„.

In the future I plan on using this site to give longer life updates, as well as talk about various things I find interesting.
